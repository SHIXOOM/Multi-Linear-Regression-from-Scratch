# Multi-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
In this mini project I tried to implement a Multi Linear Regressor from scratch to further understand the concept of linear regression and get a since of its implementation in terms of How and Why so that I get better intuition on how it works too.

<u> Hypothesis Function:</u> $h(\vec{x}) = \vec{w}.\vec{x} + b$

<u> Cost Function:</u> $J(\vec{w}, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} ((\vec{w}.\vec{x}^(i) + b) - y^(i))^2$

My Model scored an MSE of about 0.65 on California's Housing Dataset, which I think is fairly good
